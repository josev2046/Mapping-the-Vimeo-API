As developers, we often find ourselves needing to integrate third-party services into our applications. One such service that offers a rich set of features for video hosting, management, and playback is Vimeo.

While the Vimeo API and Player SDK provide comprehensive documentation, it can sometimes be challenging to grasp the overall structure and relationships between different components. That's why I've created these UML diagrams to help visualise how these tools work together - bearing in mind that the nuanced nature of certain components makes this exercise a close approximation, not an exhaustive categorisation.

The Vimeo API is a RESTful interface that allows developers to programmatically interact with Vimeo resources. It provides endpoints for managing videos, live streams, users, groups, and much more.

Figures 1, 2 and 3 illustrate some core components of the Vimeo API and their relationships. The API acts as a central hub, providing access to various resources such as videos, live streams, or metadata.

The Vimeo Player SDK is a JavaScript library that enables developers to embed and control Vimeo players within their web applications. It offers a wide range of functionalities, including playback control, fullscreen and PiP support, event handling, and data access.

Figure 4 shows the key components of the Vimeo Player SDK and their interactions. The SDK provides a Player object that can be configured with various options and methods for controlling playback, handling events, and accessing video data.
